## Overview

The template runs the project inside Docker and provides a ready-to-use Jupyter environment in VS Code together with a separate MLflow tracking server.

## Stack

* Python 3.12
* Jupyter
* pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* MLflow
* Docker / Docker Compose
* VS Code Dev Containers

```

## How it works

The project directory is mounted into the development container as:

```text
/workspace
```

VS Code connects directly to this container through Dev Containers, so notebooks use the Python environment installed in Docker rather than a local Python installation.

MLflow runs as a separate Docker service.

From notebooks:

```text
http://mlflow:5000
```

From the host:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

## Quick start

Open the repository in VS Code and run:

```text
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
```

VS Code will start the required Docker services and open the project inside the development container.

Detailed setup and troubleshooting are in [Quick_Start.md](Quick_Start.md).

## Intended use

This repository is meant to be used as a starting point for separate DS/ML projects.

Project-specific libraries can be added to `requirements.txt`, while the Docker configuration keeps the environment reproducible.
